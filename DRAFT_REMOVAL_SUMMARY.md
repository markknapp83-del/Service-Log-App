# Draft Functionality Removal - Summary

## Issue Reported
Users experienced interference with data entry when the auto-draft restoration feature would trigger, wiping existing form data with saved draft data while users were still entering information.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Removed Auto-Save Draft Functionality
- **Before**: Form automatically saved to localStorage every 2 seconds when dirty
- **After**: No automatic saving to localStorage

### ✅ Removed Draft Restoration
- **Before**: On component mount, form would check localStorage and restore saved drafts, showing "Draft restored" toast message
- **After**: No automatic restoration; localStorage drafts are cleared on mount

### ✅ Cleaned Up UI Elements
- **Removed**: "Auto-saving draft..." indicator in header
- **Removed**: "Unsaved changes" indicator in form actions
- **Removed**: Draft-related state variables (`isDraftSaving`, `draftLoadedRef`)

### ✅ Simplified Code
- **Removed**: Complex useEffect hooks for draft management
- **Removed**: Draft clearing logic from form submission and clear handlers
- **Kept**: All core form functionality (validation, submission, field management)

## What Still Works
✅ Form validation and error handling  
✅ Form submission and success/error messages  
✅ Clear form functionality  
✅ Dynamic patient entry rows  
✅ All dropdown populations (clients, activities, outcomes)  
✅ Additional notes field  
✅ Feature flag functionality (Phase 6.6)  

## What's Changed for Users
- ✅ **No more unexpected form clearing** when entering data
- ✅ **No more "Draft restored" messages**
- ✅ Clean, distraction-free form experience
- ⚠️ Users must manually save their work (no auto-save safety net)

## Technical Notes
- localStorage is cleared on component mount to remove any existing drafts
- All form state management now relies solely on React Hook Form without localStorage persistence
- Hot module reloading verified working - changes are live in browser
