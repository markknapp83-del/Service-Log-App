## 🛠 Technical Enhancements

### Database Schema Optimizations
```sql
-- New Performance Indexes Added:
CREATE INDEX idx_service_logs_user_draft ON service_logs (user_id, is_draft);
CREATE INDEX idx_service_logs_user_date ON service_logs (user_id, service_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_service_logs_date_range ON service_logs (service_date, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_patient_entries_service_log_created ON patient_entries (service_log_id, created_at);

-- SQLite Performance Settings:
PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL;
PRAGMA cache_size = -64000;    -- 64MB cache
PRAGMA temp_store = memory;
PRAGMA mmap_size = 268435456;  -- 256MB mmap
```

### API Performance Patterns
```typescript
// Batch Processing Implementation
const batchSize = 1000;
for (let i = 0; i < serviceLogs.items.length; i += batchSize) {
  const batch = serviceLogs.items.slice(i, i + batchSize);
  const batchData = await this.processBatchForExport(batch, clientMap, activityMap, outcomeMap);
  exportData.push(...batchData);
}

// Optimized Lookup Maps
const clientMap = new Map(clients.items.map(c => [c.id.toString(), c.name]));
const activityMap = new Map(activities.items.map(a => [a.id.toString(), a.name]));
```

### React 18 Concurrent Features
```typescript
// Non-blocking Filter Updates
const handleFilterChange = useCallback((newFilters) => {
  startTransition(() => {
    setFilters({ ...filters, ...newFilters });
    setCurrentPage(1);
    onFilterChange?.(updatedFilters);
  });
}, [filters, onFilterChange]);

// Memoized Data Transformation
const lookupMaps = useMemo(() => {
  const clientMap = new Map(clients.map(c => [c.id, c.name]));
  const activityMap = new Map(activities.map(a => [a.id, a.name]));
  return { clientMap, activityMap };
}, [clients, activities]);
```
